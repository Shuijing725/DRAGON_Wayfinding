When tb2 is connected to lifehome wifi, the ip address is 172.22.243.15

0. Turn on turtlebot2: 
	turn on 2 switches in level 2, then turn on the base switch
	(To turn off: 2 switches then base switch)

1. turn on the t265:
   ssh tb2xavier@192.168.1.51
   password: turtlebot

   a. launch both t265 and d435:
      roslaunch high_res.launch
   b. launch t265 only:
      roslaunch low_res.launch

2. turn on the base:
   
   ssh tb2xavier@192.168.1.51

   source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
   
   Unplug the lidar wire!!!!!!
   
   roslaunch turtlebot2i_bringup minimal.launch
   
   Change the USB port that the base will use:
   roslaunch turtlebot2i_bringup minimal.launch serialport:=/dev/ttyUSB1


3. run deepsort people tracker:

   cd Documents

   source tb2_remote.bash
   
   source cvbridge_ws/install/setup.bash

   cd deepsort

   python3 rs_deepsort_cn.py

4. turn on the lidar:

   ssh tb2xavier@192.168.1.51

   source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash && sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0 && sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1 && sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB2

   roslaunch rplidar.launch (Modify the USB port to see which one: nano rplidar.launch)
   (Guess: the port might be 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2...)
   (topic name for the lidar: /scan)

5. launch 2D lidar people detector: 

   conda deactivate && source ~/tb2.bash && source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash (if in conda env)

   source ~/virtual_envs/tb2/bin/activate

   roslaunch dr_spaam_ros dr_spaam_ros.launch

6. (Optional) visualize the detected people by 2D lidar detector:

   conda deactivate (if in conda env)

   source ~/tb2.bash

   source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
   
   rviz

   Add stuff (change map to laser, select "By topic", then add LaserScan and Marker)

7. run keyword extractor from audio:

   (download audio_script.py and location_extraction_script.py, python -m pip install pydub, and SpeechRecognition if needed)

   in tb2xavier, run roslaunch audio_capture capture.launch and roslaunch sound_play soundplay_node.py

   source ~/tb2.bash

   python audio_script.py (run speech to text, publish to /text topic) 
 
   python location_extraction_script.py (run location keyword extraction, publish to /location topic)



2. to close ternimals: Ctrl+C

When bringing up the base, if the terminal says "no input data stream, is kobuki turned on?", use the correct order to turn on 3 switches & restart everything


Teleoperation:
0. source ~tb2.bash
1. Download the teleop package from https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot and put it in a catkin worspace
2. cd into the catkin worspace, run "source devel/setup.bash"
3. for joystick: roslaunch turtlebot_teleop logitech.launch
   for keyboard: roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
